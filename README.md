# PixelProc
A minimal photoshop clone demonstrating different concepts in image processing. 

Currently:
- Converting to Gray Scale
- Quantisation
- Flipping the Image

In the Future:
- Resizing
  - [x] Nearest Neighbours
  - [ ] Bilinear
  - [ ] Bicubic 
- Spatial Domain Enhancement
  - [ ] Remove Noise
  - [ ] Enhance Contrast
  - [ ] Edge Enhancement
  - [ ] Deblur
  - [ ] Sharpening
- Spatial Filtering
  - [ ] Edge Detection
  - [ ] Removing Noise
  - [ ] Connected Components
  - [ ] Binerise
- Morphological Image Processing
  - [ ] Erosion
  - [ ] Dilaton
  - [ ] Hit and Miss
  - [ ] Corner Detection 
- Fourier Transform
- Seam Carving
- Segmentation
  - [ ] Via Edge Detection -> Prewitt, Soble, Canny
  - [ ] Thresholding 
- and more based on my Image Processing Lectures at Uni
